# Artemis

Artemis was an overnight project that was mainly used to test out how effective sniping deals in a marketplace was. Below is more information on artemis and how to use it efficiently.

## What is Artemis?

Artemis is an open source rbxflip shop sniper. What this means is it actively monitors the marketplace, once a desirable item has been listed it will instantly purchase the item and relist it if the user wants to charge a higher price or just decide to keep it. It comes built in with a config system and good configurable settings.

## How can I set it up?

Artemis was coded in python, so you'll need python 3 in order to run it (https://www.python.org/downloads/). You will also need to install the requests module which if you do not already have type the following line into your terminal ``python -m pip install requests``.

## How can I use it?

First you need to either create or choose a config within the config folder and make sure to include the cookie of the account you'll be using. After that open ``Artemis.py`` and simply change the CONFIG_NAME variable to whatever config you are using. By default it is on the Relister config. After that you can run the program and it will start working.

## What do the settings in the config do?

I have left an ExplainSettings.json file with all the settings explained inside, you can use that as a guidance.
